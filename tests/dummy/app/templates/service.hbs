<h1>As a Service</h1>

<p>
  If you would like to open and close a modal programmatically, you need to use
  ember-remodal as a service. The <code>remodal</code> service works with both
  inline and block form.
</p>

<p>
  By setting <code>forService</code> to <code>true</code>, the modal is
  registered with the <code>remodal</code> service. Keep in mind that in order
  for the <code>remodal</code> service to use a modal, it must currently be
  rendered. A common pattern would be to place an instance of
  <code>ember-remodal</code> in your application template. This pattern is
  useful in situations such as when you have a modal with a specific purpose
  that pops open and closed throughout your application, such as a "loading"
  modal.
</p>

<div class="content">
  {{code-snippet name='service-1.hbs'}}
  {{code-snippet name='service-1.js'}}
</div>

<p>
  You can refer to a modal by it's name. A modal's default name is
  <code>ember-remodal</code>.
</p>

<div class="content">
  {{code-snippet name='service-2.js'}}
</div>

<p>
  You can name a modal. This allows multiple modals with different content to
  exist at the same time. Keep in mind that in order to interact with a named
  modal, you will always refer to it by name.
</p>

<div class="content">
  {{code-snippet name='service-3.hbs'}}
  {{code-snippet name='service-3.js'}}
</div>

<p>
  You can also set properties on a modal programmatically.
</p>

<div class="content">
  {{code-snippet name='service-4.js'}}
</div>
